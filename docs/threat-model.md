## 1. Assets

| Asset | Sensitivity | Location |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| OAuth access tokens (plaintext) | Critical — grants MCP access | In-flight only; never stored |
| OAuth refresh tokens (plaintext) | Critical — long-lived session | In-flight only; never stored |
| Authorization codes (plaintext) | High — short-lived, single-use | In-flight only; never stored |
| Token hashes | Medium — not redeemable but confirm existence | `oauth-tokens` collection |
| Token pepper (`PMOAUTH_TOKEN_PEPPER`) | Critical — protects all token hashes | Environment variable |
| Payload secret | Critical — used by upstream API-key flow | Environment variable |
| User credentials | Critical | Managed by Payload core, not this plugin |
| OAuth client records | Low | `oauth-clients` collection |
| Authorization code records | Medium (pre-consumption) | `oauth-auth-codes` collection |
| Payload admin session cookies | High — gates consent screen | HTTP-only, same-site; managed by Payload |

## 2. Trust boundaries

```
[MCP client (Claude.ai)]
        │ HTTPS
        ▼
[HTTP edge — TLS termination]
        │
        ▼
[Payload server / Next.js process]
  ├── OAuth endpoints (this plugin)
  ├── MCP endpoint (upstream plugin, wrapped by this plugin)
  └── Payload admin (consent screen, session)
        │
        ▼
[Database — SQLite / Postgres]
  ├── oauth-tokens
  ├── oauth-auth-codes
  ├── oauth-clients
  └── payload-mcp-api-keys (upstream)
```

Trust boundaries crossed on each request:
- **B1:** Internet → HTTP edge (TLS required in production)
- **B2:** HTTP edge → Payload process (loopback or internal network)
- **B3:** Payload process → Database (local file or TCP with auth)

## 3. STRIDE analysis

### 3.1 Spoofing

| # | Threat | Mitigation | Task |
|---|--------|------------|------|
| S1 | Attacker presents a forged or guessed access token | Tokens are 256 bits of cryptographic entropy; brute-force is computationally infeasible (2^256 space). HMAC validation on every request. | T2.4, T3.5 |
| S2 | Attacker replays a captured access token before expiry | Access tokens have a 60-minute TTL. Revocation via `POST /api/oauth/revoke` takes effect immediately. Short TTL limits the replay window. | T2.3, T4.7 |
| S3 | Attacker replays a captured refresh token | Refresh tokens are single-use with rotation. A consumed token triggers family revocation on next use. | T3.4 |
| S4 | Attacker spoofs a registered client (misuses another client's `client_id`) | Client has no secret, but PKCE verifier must match the challenge stored at authorize time. An attacker without the verifier cannot exchange the auth code. | T3.2, T4.4 |
| S5 | Attacker intercepts an auth code in the redirect | `state` is RECOMMENDED per OAuth 2.1 + PKCE (the primary CSRF defence is PKCE, not state). The server echoes state unchanged; the client verifies it. PKCE binds the code to the originating client. HTTPS required in production. | T4.4, T4.5 |

### 3.2 Tampering

| # | Threat | Mitigation | Task |
|---|--------|------------|------|
| T1 | Attacker tampers with `redirect_uri` in authorize request to redirect auth code to attacker-controlled URL | Exact-match validation of `redirect_uri` against registered URIs (ADR-0003 §6). Any mismatch returns `invalid_request`, no redirect issued. | T4.4 |
| T2 | Attacker tampers with `scope` to elevate privileges | **Scope is not yet a privilege boundary.** The requested `scope` is informational only — it is shown on the consent screen and stored on the token, but tokens are granted the full set of capabilities enabled on the MCP server (`MCPPluginConfig`), independent of the requested scope. Tampering with `scope` therefore cannot grant *more* than the operator already enabled for all MCP clients. Per-scope capability narrowing is tracked as an enhancement (#35); until it lands, the consent screen states explicitly that approval grants all enabled tools. | T4.4 |
| T3 | Attacker tampers with `state` parameter to break CSRF binding | `state` is opaque to the server and RECOMMENDED but optional (per OAuth 2.1 §2.1.2; PKCE is the primary CSRF defence). The server echoes state unchanged; the client verifies it on receipt. Absent state is not rejected — clients relying on state alone for CSRF protection must send it. | T4.4 |
| T4 | Database row tampering — attacker with DB access modifies token capabilities | All tokens store a HMAC-protected hash. Modifying a row does not create a valid token. However, direct DB write with a known pepper could. Mitigation: restrict DB access; pepper stored separately from DB. | T2.4, T8.3 |
| T5 | Attacker modifies `code_challenge` after it is stored to accept their own verifier | `code_challenge` is written once on authorize and compared at token exchange. No update path exists. | T2.2 |

### 3.3 Repudiation

| # | Threat | Mitigation | Task |
|---|--------|------------|------|
| R1 | User denies approving a client | Consent approval is logged with `user_id`, `client_id`, `scope`, `auth_code_id`, and timestamp. | T8.2 |
| R2 | Client denies registering or making requests | Registration events, token issues, and revocations are all logged with `client_id`, `ip`, and `user_agent`. | T8.2 |
| R3 | Admin denies revoking a token | Revocation happens on the native `oauth-tokens` collection (set `revokedAt`, or delete the row) or via `POST /api/oauth/revoke`. Both run through the collection's `afterChange` hooks (cascade revocation) and are subject to Payload's standard admin action auditing; the revoke endpoint logs `client_id`/`ip`/`user_agent` (T8.2). | T8.2 |

### 3.4 Information disclosure

| # | Threat | Mitigation | Task |
|---|--------|------------|------|
| I1 | Token plaintext leaked in logs | Logging utilities (T8.2) never log Bearer headers, token values, code values, or PKCE verifiers. Only hashed IDs appear in logs. | T8.2 |
| I2 | Stack traces or DB internals returned in error responses | All error responses are RFC 6749-compliant JSON (`{"error": "...", "error_description": "..."}`) with no internal details. A global error handler catches unhandled exceptions. | T4.3–T4.7 |
| I3 | Token hash exposed if DB is compromised | Hashes are HMAC-SHA-256 with a server-side pepper. Without the pepper, hashes are not redeemable. | T2.4, T8.3 |
| I4 | Timing oracle on token lookup (reveals whether a token exists) | `validateAccessToken` locates tokens via an indexed DB equality query on the HMAC hash — the DB lookup itself is not constant-time and the not-found branch does not pad to match the found-branch timing. The actual hash comparison uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual`. Real impact is negligible: the looked-up value is an unguessable 256-bit HMAC, so a timing side-channel reveals no actionable information to an attacker. | T2.4, T3.5 |
| I5 | `client_id` enumeration via registration errors | Registration errors are returned as RFC 7591 errors without revealing whether a `client_id` already exists. | T4.3 |
| I6 | Consent screen leaks OAuth parameters in Referrer header | `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` on consent screen. Form action is same-origin. | T6.1, T8.1 |
| I7 | Auth code exposed in browser history or server logs via GET request | Auth codes are delivered as query parameters on redirects (per RFC 6749 §4.1.2). To mitigate: the redirect uses 302 (not 301, avoiding caching), and auth code records are deleted after consumption. HTTPS in production prevents interception. **Accepted risk:** query-parameter delivery is the RFC-standard mechanism; fragment delivery is not universally supported by MCP clients. | Accepted |

### 3.5 Denial of Service

| # | Threat | Mitigation | Task |
|---|--------|------------|------|
| D1 | Flood of registration requests filling `oauth-clients` collection | Per-IP rate limiting on `/register` (T4.8). Inactive/unused clients can be pruned by admin. | T4.8 |
| D2 | Flood of authorize requests creating pending sessions | Per-IP rate limiting on `/authorize` (T4.8). Pending authorize sessions are short-lived (10 minutes). | T4.8 |
| D3 | Flood of token requests | Per-IP rate limiting on `/token` (T4.8). The rate-limit key is the client IP **alone** — a client-supplied identifier is never mixed in, because rotating it would mint a fresh bucket per request and defeat the per-IP limit. IP is taken from `x-forwarded-for` (see §6). | T4.8 |
| D4 | Large-scale auth code creation exhausting DB | Auth codes expire in 60 seconds; a sweep hook purges expired records. Rate limiting bounds the creation rate. | T2.2, T4.8 |
| D5 | Token validation becomes a bottleneck at high MCP RPS | HMAC-SHA-256 lookup is O(log n) on an indexed `token_hash` column. T7.8 benchmarks the path to confirm p95 < 25 ms. | T2.3, T7.8 |
| D6 | Attacker triggers refresh-token family revocation to lock out legitimate user | If an attacker uses a stolen refresh token, family revocation runs — the legitimate user is also logged out. **Accepted risk:** this is the correct security outcome per OAuth 2.1 BCP §2.2.2. The user must re-authorize, which is a minor inconvenience compared to an active attacker using the session. | Accepted |

### 3.6 Elevation of Privilege

| # | Threat | Mitigation | Task |
|---|--------|------------|------|
| E1 | OAuth token used to access a collection capability beyond what the operator enabled | `MCPAccessSettings` is built at validation time from the capabilities **enabled on the MCP server** (`MCPPluginConfig`), never from the client's registration or self-asserted claims. Tokens currently store `{}` capabilities, so the operator-configured set is authoritative — a token can never exceed it. Note: it is *not* narrowed to the consent-screen scope (see T2); per-scope narrowing is enhancement #35. | T3.5, T4.5 |
| E2 | Attacker uses another user's access token | Tokens are bound to a `user_id`. Token validation returns the stored user, not the requesting party. The MCP handler uses `mcpAccessSettings.user` for all operations. | T3.5 |
| E3 | PKCE downgrade — attacker convinces client to use `plain` method | Only `S256` is accepted. Any request with `code_challenge_method=plain` (or absent, or any other value) returns `invalid_request` immediately. | T3.2, T4.4 |
| E4 | IDOR — non-admin views or revokes another user's tokens via the admin UI | The `oauth-clients` and `oauth-tokens` collections are operator-only management surfaces gated by the configurable `adminAccess` rule (`read`/`update`/`delete`; `create` always denied). The default authorises **only** authenticated members of the admin `userCollection` and denies the entire public REST/GraphQL surface. **Operator responsibility:** if `userCollection` mixes admins with untrusted end-users, the operator MUST supply a role-scoped `adminAccess` (documented in the README) — otherwise any such user could read others' tokens. End-users never reach these collections in the default operator-only deployment. | T5.5 |
| E5 | IDOR — user reads or modifies another user's auth code records | The `oauth-auth-codes` collection has admin-only read access in the Payload admin. Code consumption validates `user_id` match. | T2.2, T4.6 |
| E6 | Attacker registers a client with a malicious `client_name` for XSS on consent screen | `client_name` is HTML-escaped before rendering on the consent screen. Content-Security-Policy blocks inline scripts. | T4.3, T6.1 |
| E7 | Open redirect via `redirect_uri` manipulation | Exact-match redirect URI validation (ADR-0003 §6). Any non-exact match is rejected with `invalid_request` before any redirect occurs. | T4.4 |
| E8 | CSRF on consent form submission | `POST /api/oauth/consent` is **session-bound**: it requires an authenticated Payload session (`req.user`) and mints the auth code for the *session* user, never the body-supplied `user_id` (a mismatched `user_id` is rejected). The form's CSRF token is a **time-bound** HMAC over `(userId, clientId, redirectUri, codeChallenge, issuedAt)`, bound to the session user and rejected once older than 10 minutes. **Known limitation:** the token is not yet single-use; within the 10-minute TTL the same consent form could be submitted more than once, creating duplicate auth codes for the same user+client+challenge. Impact is low: same-site cookies block cross-origin submissions, PKCE binds codes to the originating client, and auth codes are themselves single-use. Tracked as enhancement #27. | T4.5 |
| E9 | Auth code injection — attacker injects a valid code obtained from another flow | Auth codes are bound to `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, and PKCE challenge. All three must match at exchange time. | T4.6 |
| E10 | Attacker calls admin-only collection endpoints directly via REST | `oauth-clients`, `oauth-auth-codes`, `oauth-tokens` collections use Payload access control set to admin-only. No public REST/GraphQL access to these collections. | T2.1–T2.3 |

---

## 4. Out-of-scope threats (accepted risks)

| Threat | Justification |
|--------|---------------|
| Compromise of the host server | Outside the plugin's responsibility. Deployers must secure the server. |
| Compromise of the database file/server | Mitigated by pepper separation (ADR-0002 §4) but a direct DB write with the pepper bypasses token validation. This is an accepted risk inherent to any server-side auth system. |
| TLS interception at the network level | HTTPS is required in production (T8.3 enforces this at boot). Certificate pinning is out of scope. |
| Malicious Payload plugins in the same process | Plugins run in the same Node.js process and can, in principle, access any in-memory data. This is a constraint of the Payload plugin model, not specific to this plugin. |
| Auth code interception via Referer header leakage | Auth codes are in query parameters, which could appear in Referer headers to third-party resources on the callback page. The MCP client's callback page is responsible for not loading third-party resources before consuming the code. **Accepted** as a client responsibility. |

## 5. Cross-cutting mitigations

These mitigations apply to the entire plugin, not a single threat:

| Control | Description | Tasks |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| HTTPS required | Boot check refuses to start in production without `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` starting with `https://`. | T8.3 |
| Security headers | `Cache-Control: no-store`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, and `X-Content-Type-Options` on all JSON OAuth responses (`jsonResponse`). Consent/authorize HTML also adds `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` (NOT `no-referrer` — that makes browsers send `Origin: null` on the consent POST, which Payload rejects → 401; see row I6), and a strict CSP. | T8.1 |
| No-store cache headers | `Cache-Control: no-store` on all token and auth code responses. | T8.1 |
| Rate limiting | Per-IP limits on all public OAuth endpoints. The key is the client IP **alone** (`ip:<ip>`); a client-supplied identifier (`client_id` / `client_name`) is deliberately never part of the key, since rotating it would mint a fresh bucket and bypass the per-IP limit. IP is taken from `x-forwarded-for`; operators behind a reverse proxy should ensure only one trusted proxy sets this header. | T4.8 |
| Audit logging | Structured log entries for all significant auth events, with no secret material. | T8.2 |
| Semgrep + CodeQL | Automated SAST in CI catches common injection and logic vulnerabilities. | T0.5 |
| gitleaks | Secret scanning in CI prevents accidental key commits. | T0.5 |
| Dependency audit | `pnpm audit` in CI fails on high/critical CVEs. | T0.5 |
| PKCE S256 only | `plain` method universally rejected. No configuration option to enable it. | T3.2 |
| Constant-time comparisons | All token hash comparisons use `crypto.timingSafeEqual`. | T2.4, T3.5 |
