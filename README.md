# @brainwebuk/payload-plugin-mcp-oauth

OAuth 2.1 + PKCE + Dynamic Client Registration for
[`@payloadcms/plugin-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@payloadcms/plugin-mcp),
so a Payload-backed MCP server can be added as a **Custom Connector in Claude.ai**
alongside the existing API-key flow.

The plugin is **purely additive**: it wraps the MCP endpoint handler and adds the
OAuth endpoints and collections. Your existing API-key MCP clients keep working
unchanged.

- OAuth 2.1 authorization-code flow with **PKCE (S256 only)**
- **Dynamic Client Registration** (RFC 7591) — Claude.ai self-registers
- Discovery via RFC 8414 / RFC 9728 well-known documents
- Tokens hashed at rest (HMAC-SHA-256); refresh + revocation supported
- **OAuth Clients** and **OAuth Tokens** appear as admin collections under the
  **MCP** nav group (admin-only; the public REST/GraphQL surface stays closed)

## Requirements

| | Version |
|---|---|
| `payload` | `^3.0.0` |
| `@payloadcms/plugin-mcp` | `^3.0.0` (tested 3.85.0) |
| `next` | `^14 \|\| ^15 \|\| ^16` (only for the exported proxy/middleware) |
| Node | `>= 20` |

---

## Install

### 1. Add the package

```bash
pnpm add @brainwebuk/payload-plugin-mcp-oauth
# or: npm i / yarn add
```

### 2. Register the plugin (after `mcpPlugin`)

In `payload.config.ts`, register `payloadMcpOAuth()` **immediately after**
`mcpPlugin()`, and pass it the **same** options object you gave to `mcpPlugin()`.

```ts
import { mcpPlugin } from '@payloadcms/plugin-mcp'
import type { MCPPluginConfig } from '@payloadcms/plugin-mcp'
import { payloadMcpOAuth } from '@brainwebuk/payload-plugin-mcp-oauth'
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

// Assign ONCE to a const and reuse the same reference in both calls. ⚠️
const mcpOptions: MCPPluginConfig = {
  collections: {
    users: { enabled: { find: true, update: true } },
    media: { enabled: { find: true, create: true } },
  },
}

export default buildConfig({
  // ...db, collections, admin, etc.
  plugins: [
    mcpPlugin(mcpOptions),
    payloadMcpOAuth({
      issuer: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL || 'http://localhost:3000',
      mcpPluginOptions: mcpOptions, // ← the SAME object, not a copy
    }),
  ],
})
```

> ⚠️ **Pass the same object reference to both calls.** The plugin installs its
> token-validation hook by mutating `mcpOptions`. If you pass a fresh object or a
> spread/copy to either call, OAuth tokens will silently fail to authenticate
> (the API-key path keeps working, which makes this easy to miss). The plugin
> also throws on boot if it is registered *before* `mcpPlugin()`.

> **Design note — why we mutate `mcpPluginOptions`.** Payload's plugin guidance
> says "never mutate the incoming config," and everything this plugin *adds*
> (collections, endpoints) is done by spreading the incoming config, not mutating
> it. The one deliberate exception is `mcpPluginOptions`: the OAuth token
> validator has to live inside `@payloadcms/plugin-mcp`'s request-handler closure,
> which Payload captures when *that* plugin runs — so we must set `overrideAuth` on
> the shared options object *before* `mcpPlugin()` executes (hence the
> same-reference rule above). This mutates a **sibling plugin's** options, which the
> [Plugin API](https://payloadcms.com/docs/plugins/plugin-api) explicitly permits
> (`plugins['…']?.options`), rather than our own incoming config. It's the most
> fragile part of the setup, so we're tracking less-footgun-prone alternatives in
> [issue #51](https://github.com/BrainWeb/payload-mcp-oauth/issues/51).

### 3. Add the proxy (Next.js 16) / middleware (Next.js 14–15)

OAuth discovery (`/.well-known/...`) and bare-host MCP connectors need two
host-level URL rewrites that a Payload plugin cannot register on its own. The
plugin ships them as a ready-made request handler — wire it up with the file
convention your Next.js version uses (next to your `app/` directory). Re-export
the handler, but declare `config` as a **local** literal.

**Next.js 16+** — Next renamed the `middleware` convention to `proxy`. Create
`src/proxy.ts`:

```ts
export { mcpOAuthMiddleware as proxy } from '@brainwebuk/payload-plugin-mcp-oauth/middleware'

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/',
    '/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server',
    '/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource',
  ],
}
```

**Next.js 14–15** — the `proxy` convention doesn't exist yet; create
`src/middleware.ts` with the same body, exported as `middleware`:

```ts
export { mcpOAuthMiddleware as middleware } from '@brainwebuk/payload-plugin-mcp-oauth/middleware'

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/',
    '/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server',
    '/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource',
  ],
}
```

> ⚠️ **Don't re-export `config`** (e.g. `export { ..., config } from '…/middleware'`).
> Next.js parses the matcher at compile time and, as of **Next 16**, hard-errors
> with *"can't recognize the exported `config` field … it mustn't be reexported"*
> — which 500s **every** route in your app. The matcher must be a static literal
> in your `proxy.ts` / `middleware.ts` itself.
>
> On Next 16 a `middleware.ts` still works but logs a deprecation warning — prefer
> `proxy.ts`. Migrate an existing file with `npx @next/codemod middleware-to-proxy .`.

Already have a proxy/middleware? Compose it instead (shown for Next 16; on 14–15
name the file `middleware.ts` and the function `middleware`):

```ts
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'
import { createMcpOAuthMiddleware } from '@brainwebuk/payload-plugin-mcp-oauth/middleware'

const mcpOAuth = createMcpOAuthMiddleware() // accepts { apiRoute, mcpEndpointPath, ... }

export function proxy(request: NextRequest) {
  // ...your logic first...
  return mcpOAuth(request)
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/', '/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server', '/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource' /* + yours */],
}
```

> No `next.config.ts` rewrites are required — the proxy/middleware handles discovery.

### 4. Set environment variables

```bash
# Public HTTPS URL clients reach. Used as the OAuth issuer + in discovery metadata.
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=https://cms.example.com

# HMAC pepper for hashing tokens at rest — REQUIRED in production (>= 32 chars).
# Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
PMOAUTH_TOKEN_PEPPER=<64-hex-chars>
```

In development a built-in insecure pepper is used if `PMOAUTH_TOKEN_PEPPER` is
unset (with a warning). In `NODE_ENV=production` the plugin **throws on boot** if
it is missing or shorter than 32 characters.

> **Keep `serverURL` consistent.** The authorize/consent flow signs the user in
> with a first-party Payload **session cookie**, so Payload's `serverURL` must be
> the same public origin clients reach (the same value as `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL`).
> Most starters already do this via `getServerSideURL()`. If `serverURL` doesn't
> match the origin the browser actually uses, the consent **Approve** POST can
> lose its session — see Troubleshooting.

### 5. Regenerate the admin import map (if your app uses one)

This plugin registers no custom admin components, so it doesn't *require* an import
map regeneration. If your app already maintains `src/app/(payload)/admin/importMap.js`,
regenerating it after installing is harmless and keeps it tidy:

```bash
pnpm payload generate:importmap
```

(Drop the `src/` prefix if your app doesn't use a `src` directory.)

### 6. Apply the schema change

The plugin adds collections (`oauth-clients`, `oauth-auth-codes`, `oauth-tokens`,
`oauth-csrf-nonces`). Use whichever schema workflow your app already uses — **don't
mix them**:

- **Dev push** (default for SQLite/Postgres in dev): just start the app; the new
  tables are pushed on next boot. Do **not** run `migrate:create`/`migrate` against
  a push-synced dev DB — you'll get *"table … already exists"*.
- **Migrations** (production): run `pnpm payload migrate:create` to generate a
  migration that includes the new collections, then `pnpm payload migrate`.

That's it — start the app and the OAuth endpoints are live, with **OAuth Clients**
and **OAuth Tokens** under the **MCP** group in the admin sidebar.

---

## Connect from Claude.ai

1. Settings → **Connectors** → **Add custom connector**.
2. Enter your server URL (the bare host, e.g. `https://cms.example.com`, works —
   the middleware routes it to the MCP endpoint).
3. Claude.ai discovers the auth server, dynamically registers, and starts the
   OAuth + PKCE handshake.
4. You'll be sent to your Payload admin login + a consent screen; approve to
   issue a token.

Verify discovery is reachable:

```bash
curl https://cms.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource
curl https://cms.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
```

## Making the MCP usable for AI agents

Once connected, an agent only knows what the MCP server *tells* it. Tools
generated from rich collections (a page builder with nested blocks, conditional
fields, etc.) are large and non-obvious, so agents trial-and-error their way
through `create*` calls. Close that gap with the guidance channels
`@payloadcms/plugin-mcp` exposes — all delivered **server → agent** over the
protocol, so they reach every client (Claude.ai web, Desktop, Code, and
non-Claude MCP clients):

- **`serverOptions.instructions`** — a "how to use this server" string on `mcpPlugin()`.
- **per-collection `description`** — tells the agent when/why to use a collection.
- **field `admin.description`** — flows into each tool's input schema, so the
  agent reads field rules inline (e.g. "required only when …").
- **`prompts`** — pre-baked, guided workflows the agent can invoke.

```ts
mcpPlugin({
  serverOptions: {
    serverInfo: { name: 'Author Website', version: '1.0.0' },
    instructions: `
This server manages an author marketing site (pages, posts, media).
- Publish by setting "_status": "published".
- pages.hero.type is none|lowImpact|mediumImpact|highImpact; high/mediumImpact
  REQUIRE hero.media (a Media id) — upload first; prefer lowImpact otherwise.
- pages.layout is an array of blocks: content, cta, mediaBlock, archive, formBlock.
- If a tool schema is large, create a minimal doc first, then add blocks with the update tool.`,
  },
  collections: {
    pages: {
      description: 'Landing/marketing pages built from a hero + layout blocks.',
      enabled: { find: true, create: true, update: true },
    },
  },
})
```

> **Why not ship a Claude Skill for this?** Skills load only from the *consuming*
> client's own environment — an MCP server (or this npm package) cannot push a
> Skill to a connecting Claude.ai/Desktop agent. `instructions`/`prompts` are the
> protocol-native equivalent and reach every client automatically. (A Skill *is*
> useful for the **install** experience — see below.)

### Install helper for Claude Code (optional)

This repo doubles as a Claude Code plugin marketplace with an `install` skill that
walks Claude Code through wiring up the plugin (config, proxy, env, schema) and the
common pitfalls. In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add BrainWeb/payload-mcp-oauth
/plugin install payload-mcp-oauth@brainwebuk
```

Then ask Claude Code to "install payload-plugin-mcp-oauth" (or run
`/payload-mcp-oauth:install`). This helps the **developer** installing the plugin;
because Skills are client-side it has no effect on the runtime connector agent.

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `issuer` | `string` | — (required) | Public base URL; OAuth issuer + metadata base. |
| `mcpPluginOptions` | `MCPPluginConfig` | — (required) | The **same** object passed to `mcpPlugin()`. |
| `userCollection` | `string` | `'users'` | Collection holding user accounts. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Turn OAuth off without uninstalling: no endpoints, no token wiring, `mcpPluginOptions` untouched (API-key MCP keeps working). Collections stay registered for schema consistency. Also auto-detected when `mcpPluginOptions.disabled` is set. |
| `adminAccess` | `Access` | authenticated user in `userCollection` | Who may view/manage the OAuth collections in the admin. See below. |
| `accessTokenTtlSeconds` | `number` | `3600` | Access-token lifetime. |
| `refreshTokenTtlSeconds` | `number` | `86400` | Refresh-token lifetime. |
| `authCodeTtlSeconds` | `number` | `300` | Authorization-code lifetime. |
| `rateLimits` | `RateLimitOptions` | `{}` | Per-endpoint rate-limit overrides. |

### Admin UI & access

`oauth-clients` and `oauth-tokens` render as collections under the **MCP** nav
group (alongside the MCP plugin's API Keys). `read`/`update`/`delete` are gated by
`adminAccess`; `create` is always denied (clients self-register via DCR, tokens are
minted by the token endpoint). `oauth-auth-codes` and `oauth-csrf-nonces` stay
hidden and fully locked.

The default `adminAccess` authorises any authenticated user **in your
`userCollection`** and denies the public REST/GraphQL surface — correct for the
standard starters, where `users` holds only operators. **If your `userCollection`
mixes admins with untrusted end-users, pass your own rule:**

```ts
payloadMcpOAuth({
  issuer,
  mcpPluginOptions: mcpOptions,
  adminAccess: ({ req }) => req.user?.role === 'admin',
})
```

### Endpoints added

`GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`,
`POST /api/oauth/register`, `GET /api/oauth/authorize`, `POST /api/oauth/consent`,
`POST /api/oauth/token`, `POST /api/oauth/revoke`.

OAuth tokens use the `pmoauth_` prefix. The MCP handler checks the Bearer value:
`pmoauth_…` takes the OAuth path; anything else delegates to the original API-key
handler unchanged.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `Error: payloadMcpOAuth must be registered AFTER mcpPlugin()` | Plugin order — put `payloadMcpOAuth()` after `mcpPlugin()`. |
| OAuth tokens 401 but API keys work | `mcpPluginOptions` wasn't the **same** object reference (step 2). |
| `/.well-known/...` returns the app's HTML / 404 | `proxy.ts` / `middleware.ts` missing or its `matcher` doesn't include the well-known paths (step 3). |
| **Every** route 500s; log says *"can't recognize the exported `config` field … it mustn't be reexported"* | `config` was re-exported from `…/middleware` instead of declared as a local literal in your `proxy.ts` / `middleware.ts` (step 3). |
| `The "middleware" file convention is deprecated` warning (Next 16) | Rename `src/middleware.ts` → `src/proxy.ts` and export the handler as `proxy` (step 3). |
| Consent screen renders, but **Approve** returns `401 access_denied / "Authentication required"` | Plugin bug in **≤ 0.3.0**: the consent page sent `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, so browsers sent `Origin: null` on the Approve POST and Payload dropped the session (the `GET` render has no `Origin`, so it worked; the `POST` didn't). **Fixed in 0.3.1 — upgrade.** If it persists on ≥ 0.3.1, your `serverURL` doesn't match the origin the browser uses — check `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` (exact scheme + host, no trailing slash). |
| **OAuth Clients / OAuth Tokens** missing from the admin nav, or their route shows *"Nothing found"* | The logged-in user isn't authorised by `adminAccess`. By default they must belong to `userCollection`; for mixed-role apps pass a custom `adminAccess` (see *Admin UI & access*). |
| `migrate` fails with *"table … already exists"* | You ran `migrate` against a DB already created by dev push — pick one workflow (step 6). |
| `SQLITE_ERROR: no such column: oauth_clients_id` while rebuilding `payload_locked_documents_rels` on `pnpm dev` | SQLite push can't add the new collections' lock-FK columns to an **already-pushed** DB (a Payload/drizzle rebuild quirk). **Fixed in 0.3.2** — the OAuth collections set `lockDocuments: false`, so they add no column there. On ≤ 0.3.1: add the plugin *before* first boot, or reset the dev DB (`rm your.db*`) so the schema is created fresh. |
| Boots fine in dev, throws on deploy | `PMOAUTH_TOKEN_PEPPER` not set in production (step 4). |

---

## Development

This repo is a pnpm workspace: the published plugin lives in `packages/plugin`, and
`examples/payload-app` is a reference Payload 3 app (SQLite) used for integration
testing.

```bash
pnpm install                  # once, at the repo root
pnpm dev:example              # run the reference example app (workspace source)
pnpm --filter ./packages/plugin build   # build the plugin
pnpm test                     # unit tests across the workspace
pnpm typecheck                # type-check
pnpm lint                     # lint
```

### Spin up a test site from the packaged plugin

`test:install:serve` installs the **packed** plugin (`pnpm pack`, i.e. the real
published artifact) into a throwaway app, wires it up exactly as the docs above
describe, and leaves `next dev` running so you can click around — including the
OAuth admin screens.

```bash
pnpm test:install:serve              # http://localhost:3000
pnpm test:install:serve -- --port 4000
pnpm test:install:serve -- --reuse   # skip the rebuild, reuse the last install (fast restart)
```

It prints the URL and a seeded admin login (`install-test@example.com` /
`install-test-password-123`). It is **fresh-by-default** — every launch reprovisions
from the freshly packed plugin so you never click around a stale build; pass
`--reuse` once a launch has succeeded for a faster restart. First run is slow (a full
`pnpm install` + cold compile — allow a couple of minutes). Press Ctrl+C to stop.

### Run the from-scratch install test

```bash
pnpm test:install                    # asserts the full install + OAuth handshake end to end
pnpm test:install -- --keep          # keep the temp app on success, for debugging
```

This is the harness that drives packaging, the admin import map, schema push, the
OAuth + PKCE handshake, admin visibility/access gating, the disabled matrix, and
incremental install — see [`scripts/install-test/README.md`](scripts/install-test/README.md)
for the full list of what it checks and why.
